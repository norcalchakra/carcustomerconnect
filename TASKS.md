## Pending Tasks

- [ ] Run `quick_rls_fix.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
- [ ] Test vehicle creation with the Debug component visible
- [ ] Check browser console for detailed logs
- [ ] Once working, replace permissive policy with more secure one:
  ```sql
  CREATE POLICY "Users can insert vehicles to their dealership"
  ON vehicles
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    dealership_id IN (
      SELECT id FROM dealerships WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
  ```
- [ ] Remove debugging components once everything is working properly
- [ ] Consider adding error handling for cases where a user doesn't have a dealership

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Implement proper error handling for API calls
- [ ] Add proper validation for vehicle forms
- [ ] Create a dealership management interface
