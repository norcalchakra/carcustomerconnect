*For Car Customer Connect - AI Caption Generation System*

## Purpose Statement

This document outlines the comprehensive information collection system during dealer onboarding that will serve as the foundation for our AI-powered caption generation. The goal is to capture the unique voice, style, and business characteristics of each dealership to ensure generated content authentically represents their brand while maintaining effectiveness across all vehicle lifecycle stages.

## Core Dealership Information

- **Primary Phone Number**: Main sales line for customer inquiries
- **Service Department Phone**: Separate number if applicable
- **Website URL**: Primary domain for inventory browsing
- **Physical Address**: Complete street address for location-based marketing
- **Google Maps Plus Code**: For precise location services
- **Years in Business**: Establishes credibility in generated content
- **Dealership Type**: Independent, franchise, specialty (luxury, budget, specific makes)
- **Primary Market Radius**: How far customers typically travel (affects localization in posts)

### Brand Voice Configuration

## Implementation Notes

This comprehensive onboarding system should be presented progressively, not as an overwhelming form. Consider a guided wizard approach that:

1. Starts with essential business information
2. Uses AI to suggest voice settings based on initial examples
3. Allows skipping sections with smart defaults
4. Provides immediate preview of how choices affect output
5. Enables ongoing refinement post-launch

The richness of this contextual data will enable the AI to generate authentic, effective, and dealership-specific content that truly sounds like it comes from their team rather than a generic bot.
